# ptoh_webhooks
This repository solely exists to let PToH send webhook messages to the Discord server. `hooks.hyra.io` used to be the bridge between the two, but it stopped working around 2 months ago.

If you want to copy this setup for your own Roblox game, all you need to know is that the secret variables contain the full webhook link. Also you have to make your repository public.
